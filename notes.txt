useState: When you need to remember or store something that changes
useEffect: When you want to run something automatically when the page loads or changes
Functions: When you want to do something based on user actions

Do I need to remember something over time? → useState

Do I want to do something when the page loads? → useEffect

Do I want to respond to a user action (type, click)? → function

Do I want to style something based on a condition? → function (usually using state)

| What you want to do                                           | What you should use                         |
